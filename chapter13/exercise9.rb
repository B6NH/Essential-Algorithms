# Exercise 9
# No, minimal spanning tree algorithm at each step selects
# the closest node but it doesnt guarantee that the resulting
# path to target node will be the best.

# Directed Network (all links go down)
#          A
#      5 /   \ 3
#       B     C
#      1 \   / 4
#          D


# Minimal Spanning Tree - links = [5,3,4]
# Shortest Path Tree - links = [5,3,1]

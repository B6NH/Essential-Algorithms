# Exercise 7
# HAM -> HAMC
# Check with HAMC algorithm if network contains cycle.
# If it does, remove last link and return path.
# Otherwise try adding links to every pair of nodes
# that are not connected and look for cycles with HAMC
# algorithm. If cycle was found it means that network
# contains HAM path.

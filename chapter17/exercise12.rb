# Exercise 12
# Find maximal possible value with detection algorithm. Start with
# sum of all values and decrement detect(x) argument until answer
# is true. After finding max valid parameter, loop through all
# objects and remove them if possible. At the end, remaining set
# of elements is the final solution.
